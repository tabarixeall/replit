### User-Specific Data Access and Copy Functionality ✓
- **User-Specific Webhook Responses**: Modified webhook data to be user-specific instead of global
  - Users can only see their own pressed 1 data, not other users' data
  - Added `getUserWebhookResponses()` method for user-scoped queries
  - Updated `/api/webhook-responses` endpoint to require authentication and filter by user ID
- **Copy Functionality**: Added copy buttons for pressed 1 data in both user and admin interfaces
  - Copy format: "contactdetails|email|phonenumber" when email is available, or "contactdetails|phonenumber" when no email
  - Examples: "John Doe|john@example.com|254748977033" or "Jane Smith|254748977034"
  - Only appears for responses where button "1" was pressed
  - Includes toast notifications for success/error feedback
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Fixed all back button routing consistency across the application
  - Webhook dashboard back button now correctly routes to root (/) instead of non-existent /call-center
  - Added back button to admin panel for easy return to main application

### Complete Data Isolation Implementation ✓
- **User-Specific Call History**: Users can only see their own call records via authenticated `/api/calls` endpoint
- **User-Specific Bulk Campaigns**: Users can only see and manage their own campaigns via authenticated `/api/bulk-calls` endpoint
- **Campaign Ownership Verification**: Added ownership checks before allowing campaign start/stop operations
- **Admin Data Access**: Separate admin endpoints (`/api/admin/calls`, `/api/admin/bulk-calls`, `/api/admin/webhook-responses`) for full system visibility
- **Static Connect XML**: Added `/connect` endpoint serving static XML for SIP dial actions with predefined SIP account configuration

### Concurrent Bulk Calling Enhancement ✓
- **True Concurrent Processing**: Replaced sequential call processing with batch-based concurrent execution
- **Batch Processing**: Processes up to 100 concurrent calls per batch for optimal performance
- **Improved Speed**: Eliminated 1-second delays between individual calls for faster campaign execution
- **API Rate Management**: Maintains 2-second delays between batches to respect API limits
- **Progress Tracking**: Enhanced batch-by-batch progress reporting for better monitoring

### Campaign Cancellation Feature ✓
- **Real-time Cancellation**: Added ability to cancel in-progress bulk call campaigns
- **Backend API**: Implemented `/api/bulk-calls/:id/cancel` endpoint with ownership verification
- **Campaign Status Monitoring**: Bulk calling function checks for cancellation status between batches
- **Frontend Controls**: Added red "Cancel" button for in-progress campaigns in the UI
- **Immediate Response**: Campaign stops processing new batches immediately when cancelled
- **Status Management**: Properly clears active campaign status and unlocks XML updates upon cancellation

### Enhanced Call Failure Detection ✓
- **Proper API Response Analysis**: Updated both single and bulk call endpoints to correctly detect failures
- **Status Code vs Response Content**: Apidaze returns 202 for both success and failure - now checking response body content
- **Success Indicators**: Validating presence of 'ok' field or call_uuid/id in successful responses
- **Failure Detection**: Detecting 'failure' field in response body to properly record failed calls
- **Accurate Statistics**: Failed calls now properly recorded and counted in campaign statistics

### Real-Time Webhook Notifications ✓
- **WebSocket Integration**: Added WebSocket server for real-time communication between server and clients
- **Popup Notifications**: Created animated notification popups that appear when someone presses 1 on campaigns
- **Auto-Fade System**: Notifications automatically fade after 5 seconds and close after 8 seconds
- **Connection Status**: Added live connection indicator in the header showing WebSocket status
- **Multi-Campaign Support**: When a phone number exists in multiple campaigns, separate notifications are sent to each campaign owner
- **User-Specific Notifications**: Only campaign owners receive notifications for their own campaigns
- **Real-Time Updates**: Instant notifications appear without page refresh when webhook responses are received

## Data Flow

### Single Call Flow
1. **Call Initiation**: User fills out call form → Frontend validation → API request to backend
2. **Backend Processing**: Validate request → Call Apidaze API → Store call record in database
3. **Response Handling**: Return API response → Update frontend state → Show success/error toast
4. **History Display**: Fetch call history from database → Display in table format with status indicators

### Bulk Call Flow
1. **Campaign Creation**: User pastes contacts → Parse and format phone numbers → Create bulk call campaign
2. **Contact Processing**: Link contacts to campaign → Store formatted and original phone numbers
3. **Campaign Execution**: Asynchronous call processing → 1-second delays between calls → Real-time status tracking
4. **Progress Updates**: Track completed/failed calls → Update campaign status → Store individual call records
